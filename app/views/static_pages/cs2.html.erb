            <ul>
                <li>The enrollment management process should be as easy and quick, preferrably automated.</li>
                <li>The district management aspect should include full range of capabilities to adjust or edit enrollment.</li>
                <li>User flow should be streamlined so users do not need to contact customer support for small matters.</li>
            </ul>

        <h3>AFFINITY MAP</h3>
